# Agile
## Values
Individuals and interactions > Processes and tools

Working software > Comprehensive documentation

Customer collaboration > Contract negotiation

Responding to change > Following a plan

## Principles
### Regular delivery of software
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter time scale.

Working software is the primary measure of progress.

Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

### Team communication
Stakeholders and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

### Excellence in design
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

Simplicity – the art of minimizing the amount of work done – is essential.

Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
