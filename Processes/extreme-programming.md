# Extreme Programming
## Values
Communication - Among the team

Simplicity - The simplest thing that could possibly work

Feedback - As much feedback as quickly as possible

Courage - To do the best thing

Respect - Among the team and stakeholders

## Principles
- Basic human needs
- Economics
- Mutual benefit
- Applying the same concept in different contexts
- Improvement – the best you can today, striving for better tomorrow
- Team diversity
- Reflection
- Continuous flow of all activities concurrently
- Opportunity to learn and improve
- Redundancy
- Fail fast, fail often
- High quality
- Small changes
- Responsibility is accepted not assigned

## Practices
- Open Workspace
- Whole Team
  - Cross-functional team
  - Stable team membership
  - Customer on hand at all times and available for questions
- Informative Workspace
- Sustainable Pace
  - No overtime allowed until the end
- Pair Programming
  - Rotate pairs frequently
- User Stories
  - Conversation about a requirement
  - Estimate of development time 
  - Split into multiple user stories if necessary
  - Not an exhaustive, permanent list
- Iteration Planning
  - 1 - 3 weeks, usually 2 weeks
  - Deliverable software
  - Customer selects user stories to fit within the budget
  - User stories in the iteration are not changed
- Task Planning
  - Anyone can sign up for any task
  - Half-way meeting to ensure half of the stories are complete and to evaluate the remainder
- Release Planning
  - Approximately 6 iterations
  - Worthy of production
  - Customer selects user stories to fit within the budget
  - Changeable
- Project Planning
  - Iterations
  - Implementation velocity
  - Burn-down chart
- Defining “Done”
- Acceptance Tests
  - Specified by the customer
  - Automated
  - Act as the true requirements
  - Access the business logic without a UI
  - First stage of an iteration
- Automated Build
- Continuous Integration
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Refactoring
- Incremental Design
  - Consider the simplest thing that could possibly work
  - You aren’t going to need it (YAGNI)
  - Don’t repeat yourself (DRY)
  - Postpone decisions until the last responsible moment
- Continuous Deployment
- Root-Cause Analysis
  - Ask ‘Why?’ 5 times
- Collective Ownership
  - Nobody has more authority than anybody else over a module or a technology
- No permanent artifacts other than Code and Tests
- Single code branch
- Ongoing negotiation of scope
