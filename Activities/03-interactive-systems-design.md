# Interactive Systems Design

## Understanding (Requirements)
### PACT Analysis
People

- Personas

Activities in Contexts

- User stories
- Scenarios
- Use cases

Technologies

## Design
### Conceptual
Mental model of the overall purpose of the whole system

- Included information
- Included functions
- Prerequisite knowledge or skills
- Clear conceptualization of solution
- Communication of conceptualization
- Metaphors

### Physical
Operational

- Content structure
- Content storage
- Processes
- Flow
- Events

Representational

- Look and feel

Interactions

- Functions of humans
- Functions of technology
- Structure interactions
- Sequence interactions

Design language

- Patterns and representation
- Design elements such as colour, styles, types of widgets
- Principles of composing elements
- Qualifying situations (effect of contexts)

## Envisionment
- UML diagrams
- Concrete scenarios
- Sketches, snapshots
- Storyboards
- Navigation maps
- Wireframes
- Prototypes
  - Hi-fi
  - Lo-fi
  - Video
  - Horizontal
  - Vertical

## Evaluation
*(From Benyon)*

Performed by external interaction design expert and representative participants

Accessible

- Physically
- Conceptually
- Economically
- Culturally
- Socially

Accessibility Guidelines

- Does not disadvantage or stigmatize a group
- Accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities
- Easy to understand
- Communicates information effectively
- Tolerates unintended actions
- Low physical effort
- Appropriate size and space

Usable

- User can translate a goal into an action
- User can evaluate whether result of action was successful toward the goal

Acceptable

- Politically
- Convenience
- Culturally and socially
- Usefulness
- Economically

General principles

- Visible, perceivable
- Consistent
- Familiar
- Affordances
- Navigable
- Control: communicates who/what, how, why
- Responsive feedback
- Recoverable from mistakes/errors
- Constrained input
- Flexible
- Stylish
- Pleasant, polite

User experience (UX) principles

- Engaging
  - Identifiable
  - Adaptable
  - Good story
  - Immersive
  - Flow
  - Emotion (affect)
- Pleasurable
  - Physiologically
  - Socially
  - Psychologically: cognitively, emotionally
  - Ideologically: values
- Aesthetically pleasing

Psychological principles

- Gestalt laws
  - Proximity
  - Similarity (colour, shape, size)
  - Common fate
  - Continuity
  - Closure
  - Figure/ground
- Short-term memory is limited to 4 +/- 1 chunks for a few seconds
- Recognition is easier and quicker than recall
- Red/green and blue/yellow colour blindness
- Colours
- Survey and route knowledge for navigation

Managing conceptual load

- Archetypes – universal forms that we grow to expect
- Hierarchal organization – simplest structure for visualizing and understanding complexity

Increasing productivity

- Fitt’s Law – bigger options reduce time to find and use, further options increase time
- Hick’s Law – increasing number of options increases time to find and use a particular option
- Flexibility-Usability tradeoff
- Pareto Principle (80/20 rule)
- Principle of least effort – users choose easiest way
- Progressive disclosure

Human visual system

- Inattentional blindness – if you’re not looking for something you often won’t see it
- Gutenberg diagram scanning – our culture scans screens from top-left to bottom-right
- Interference effects – Stroop effect
- Horror vacui – fear of emptiness, clutter decreases value perception

Human preference for natural effects

- Prefer naturalness – Wabi-Sabi
- Biophilia effect
- Savannah effect – prefer open space
- Whitespace
- Prefer subtle gradients with light from top
- Contour bias (curved over sharp)
- Desire line – natural route between two points
- Animation
- 3-dimensional

Beauty, first impressions, general impressions

- Aesthetic-Usability effect – people think beautiful things work better
- Attractiveness bias – symmetry, alignment, colour, typeface, font size, font weight, contrast
- Expectation effect – experience and expectations influence perceptions
- Priming – activating specific concepts in memory influences subsequent behavior
- Exposure effect – repeated exposure to neutral stimuli increases likeability

Meeting business needs

- Performance vs Preference – business efficiency does not always match user preference
- Personas – different designs for different types of users
- Ockham’s Razor – prefer simplicity over complexity
- Cost-benefit – whether adding a feature is worth the cost to business or users
- Satisficing – stop when design is good enough since you will never please everyone

Hierarchy of needs

1. Functionality – basic requirements are possible
2. Reliability – stable and consistent
3. Usability – easy and forgiving
4. Proficiency – advanced features
5. Creativity – allow novel uses

General

- Layering – organizing information into groups and presenting particular groups
- Mapping control to function
- Highlighting
- Nudge – predictably alter behavior (defaults, indicators, incentives, performance measures, structured choices)
- Entry point – affordance that initiates an interaction
- Forgiveness – reverse action instead of confirmation
- Visibility – errors, warnings, progress, status change
- Confirmation – for irreversible actions

Touch context

- Gesture lexicon
- Appropriate element size
- Horizontal scrolling
