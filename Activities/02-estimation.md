# Estimation
When asked for an estimate respond with "I'll get back to you." and take your time.

All estimates are based on models of the problem, decomposed into components.

## Cone of Uncertainty
Estimates are up to 4 times under- or over-estimated at the start. Estimation becomes more accurate as progress is made.

Iterate the schedule with the code by refining the estimate after each iteration.

## Deadly Warning Signs
- Someone other than the team is doing the estimation
- Historical performance is ignored
- Estimates are treated as commitments
- Estimates are rejected if they don't fit into an existing plan

## Planning Poker
"Poll the audience" until the estimate converges.

## Sizes
- Absolute time units
  - For less than a day quote in "hours"
  - For 1-15 days quote in "days"
  - For 3-8 weeks quote in "weeks"
  - For 8-30 weeks quote in "months"
  - For 30+ weeks take your time
- Relative units (points)
  - T-shirt sizes
  - Fibonacci series

## Velocity
A team's average productivity per week.
